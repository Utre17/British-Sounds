## 🎨 **Design Philosophy**

### **Session 1: Academic Learning**
- Traditional vowel sound pairs
- Systematic practice progression
- Focus on sound discrimination

### **Session 2: Problem-Solution-Scenario**
- Real-world communication breakdowns
- Practical application in context
- Scenario-based learning with consequences

This approach creates variety in learning methods while maintaining consistency in visual design and user experience.

## 📊 **Project Statistics**

- **Total Sessions**: 6 (2 complete, 4 pending)
- **Audio Files**: 22 total (9 working, 13 missing)
- **Interactive Elements**: 50+ audio buttons across sessions
- **Learning Challenges**: 6 (3 vowel pairs, 3 consonant pairs)
- **Code Files**: 3 main files (HTML, CSS, JS)

## 🔄 **Continuation Instructions**

When resuming work:
1. Upload the 13 missing audio files first
2. Test Session 2 thoroughly
3. Begin work on Session 3 (Word Stress)
4. Consider adding visual feedback for audio playback
5. Implement remaining sessions following established patterns

The foundation is solid - Session 1 works perfectly, Session 2 needs only audio files, and the framework is ready for Sessions 3-6.
